Data:
Supplementary Data.xlsx
Contains data extracted from Ediacaran trace fossil Lamonte trevallis surface in the Shibantan biota, Yangtze Gorges area, South China. Length units are in centimeter. 
	Sheet1 all tracefossils: data of traces, connected plugs and isolated plugs. 
	Containing positions(X, Y), axis length of plugs (Long axis, Short axis), orientation of plugs (Orientation), traces lengths (Length) and traces widths (Width). Extracted from Inkscape using a custom script written in Haskell (https://github.com/egmitchell/dex).

	Sheet2 segment positions: data of traces' segments.
	Start (x0,y0) and end (x1,y1) points of all segments.
	Segments positions were extracted from Inkscape using a custom script written in Haskell (https://github.com/egmitchell/traces).
